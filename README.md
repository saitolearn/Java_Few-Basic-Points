# Java: A Simple Guide for Beginners

Q1. What is Java?
Java is a popular programming language used to build apps, websites, and software. 
Think of it like a set of instructions that tells your computer what to do. It’s used by big companies like Google, Netflix, and Amazon.


Q2. What are the Features of Java?
Here are some key features of Java:
•	🟢 Simple: Easy to learn and use.
•	🔐 Secure: Helps protect against hacking.
•	🚀 Fast: Runs quickly thanks to smart design.
•	🌍 Platform-Independent: Write code once, run it anywhere.
•	🔁 Object-Oriented: Uses real-world-like objects in programming.
•	⚙️ Robust: Designed to catch errors and avoid crashes.


Q4. What is JDK and Its Components?
JDK stands for Java Development Kit. It’s like a toolbox that developers use to write Java programs.
Main components of JDK:
•	📦 JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Runs Java programs.
•	✏️ Compiler: Converts your code into something the computer understands.
•	🔧 Debugger: Helps fix errors in your code.
•	📚 Libraries: Ready-made code you can use in your projects.


Q5. Is JVM Platform-Independent?
Yes! JVM (Java Virtual Machine) lets Java code run on any device – Windows, Mac, or Linux – without changing the code. 
That’s why Java is famous for its 'write once, run anywhere' ability.


Q6. What is the Difference Between JDK and JRE?
Think of it like this:
🧰 JDK (Java Development Kit) = JRE + tools for developers.
▶️ JRE (Java Runtime Environment) = Only the part that runs Java programs.

If you're coding in Java, you need JDK. If you're just running Java apps, JRE is enough!
